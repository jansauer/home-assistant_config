* Conditionally style the header based on the state of entities.
* Per user/device settings using usernames, user agents, and media queries.

## Important notes:

* Hiding the header or options button will remove your ability to edit from the UI. In this case, you can restore the default header by adding "?disable_cch" to the end of your URL. Example: `http://192.168.1.42:8123/lovelace/0?disable_cch`
* The card will automatically display when "configuring UI" to allow for editing, but is otherwise hidden.
* If hiding tabs, while in edit mode there is a new option in the options drop-down menu "Show All Tabs" to help with configuration.
* To use with panel view place this card inside a "container card" with the panel card (vertical stack card, layout-card, etc.), otherwise this card isn't "displayed" and won't load. Example below.
<details>
  <summary><b>Panel View Example:</b></summary>

Placing this card at the end of the vertical stack can help with some spacing issues.

```yaml
views:
- title: Panel View Example
  panel: true
  cards:
  - type: vertical-stack
    cards:
    - type: another-card
    - type: custom:compact-custom-header
```
</details>
